# How [Brian Boyer](/) built this happy little website.

brianboyer.net was built with the lovely static site generator, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). It's hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which is delightful to use.

The fonts are hosted by Google: [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) and [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather). [type-scale](https://type-scale.com/?size=16&scale=1.250&text=A%20Visual%20Type%20Scale&font=Lato&fontweight=900&bodyfont=Merriweather&bodyfontweight=400&lineheight=1.55&backgroundcolor=white&fontcolor=%23333&preview=false) and [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) came in very handy for balancing my typography and making that little red icon (which looks like Merriweather, but is actually using [Patua One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patua+One)).

Soothing blues and searing reds via Team Zissou and [Present & Correct](https://wesandersonpalettes.tumblr.com/post/79956949771/steve-zissou-dont-point-that-gun-at-him-hes-an).

You can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/brianboyer/brianboyer.net).

And thanks to [Wilto](https://hire.wil.to/) for the inspiration!
