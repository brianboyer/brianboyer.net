# How I built this website

brianboyer.net is an old-fashioned, static website, generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). It's hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which is delightful to use.

The fonts are hosted by Google: [Saira](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Saira) and [Gravitas One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gravitas+One). And [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) came in very handy for making that little red icon.

[A killer Lightning Hopkins album cover](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/56569/lightnin-hopkins-shake-it-baby-album-art) was inspiring, via Fonts In Use.
