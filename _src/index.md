# Let’s work together

Hi, I’m Brian Boyer.

I started as a programmer and got into journalism as my second career. After several years working as an editor in large/national newsrooms, I found my calling **building better products** with small, (usually) local, nonprofit news organizations.

## What’s that like?

I’ve helped teams…

- Create, plan and execute a product strategy
- Improve their website user experience
- Migrate to a new content management system
- Grow their email list, and send better newsletters and fundraising appeals
- Set up analytics and measure success

Being a product leader means that I’m a generalist, though I’m still a software developer at heart. And I spent many years working in data journalism, so I’m a nerd for the numbers.

My newsroom teams were small, but we consistently punched above our weight, because we worked together effectively, and always put the audience’s needs first. Nowadays, **my mission is to teach those skills and leave your team smarter, happier and more powerful.**

So what do you get when you work with me? Coaching, teamwork, data-driven strategy, user-centered design, and, among other things, the best damned spreadsheets you’ve ever seen. :)

## How might we work together?

My joke is that I’m your friendly, neighborhood Chief Product Officer. But most small newsrooms can’t afford (or make good use of) a full-time product nerd. So I usually work on contract, short- or long-term, and always part time.

That works out for everyone, because the rest of the day is for cooking and taking care of my kid.
