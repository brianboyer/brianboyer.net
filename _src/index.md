# Hi, I'm Brian Boyer.

I'm an experienced [leader](/resume/), occasional [writer](/writing/) and [award-winning](/awards/) journalist.

I'm currently available for consulting, contract work, and full-time employment. I’m happy to come to you, but full-time work must be remote/Chicago-friendly.

Now that we’ve got that out of the way...

## What's up?

I’ve worn a lot of hats in my career: technologist, journalist, designer, data-wrangler, project manager, and product owner, to name a few. Those are very different jobs, but the thru-line — and the secret to my success — is that I care deeply about teams.

And teams kick ass when we...
- Work selflessly — not tirelessly — and care for each other.
- Question dogma, test our assumptions, and value humility and curiosity.
- Build an inclusive workplace, and a team that represents our audience.
- Know our values — *why* we do what we do, not just *what* or *how*.
- Set goals that align with our mission, communicate them clearly and passionately, prioritize rigorously, and measure success everyday.

For the last two years, my job role has been “product and people.” It’s a lot to explain, but broadly speaking, I’ve been working to build a membership-driven news business, while at the same time, professionalizing the operations of a fast-growing company.

I’m currently on the hunt for kind, thoughtful, mission-driven people doing great work. And a place where I can use the breadth of my experience to make the world a little better. Does this sound like you? I’d love to learn more about your team, and your vision for the future.

Here are some of the things I can do for you!

### Building membership-powered organizations
I’ve spent the last two years building successful membership programs for [Denverite](https://denverite.com), [Billy Penn](https://billypenn.com) and [The Incline](https://theincline.com). It’s tempting to think of this as a technical problem — CRM, payment processing, etc. But while the technical stuff can be a challenge, the real challenge is that your organization must learn to act differently. (link TK?) I can help your team understand the high-level philosophy, as well as all the details you’ve got to get right — from the roles of your team and your approach to your work, to the nitty-gritty of product design, vendor and tool selection, email marketing, and metrics.

### Inclusive team-building
Building a team is one of the great privileges in life. And with great privilege comes great responsibility. So, congratulations! You worked your ass off to get the budget, and now it’s time to do the *real* work. I can help you recruit, hire, and lead the team that will best serve your audience’s needs — one that is build inclusively, represents your audience, and works together to solve hard problems. Happy, productive teams are rarely built by luck. You’ve got to be intentional at every step of the process, and change as your team grows and learns.

### Smelling bullshit
The other day I was joking about being a professional “vendor sniffer” — I’ve evaluated hundreds (thousands?) of tools, most of which were bullshit. As a hiring manager, awards judge, grant judge and vendor sniffer, I’ve developed a keen sense for what’s crap, and what tools and teams know are great at what they do. If you’re looking for help deciding on a technology stack, evaluating a RFP, hiring a consulting firm, or awarding grantees, hit me up. I can help you better understand the problem you’re trying to solve, and choose the best path to solve it.

### User-centered product development
There’s a thing about products that should be obvious, but that we regularly fail at. (Especially in journalism.) Say it with me: “We design products to serve the needs of our audience.” Product, design and audience work are three sides of the same, um, three-sided coin. :) I can help you better understand the needs of your audience, facilitate design exercises with your team, and distill a product strategy. We might decide to make a niche newsletter, a task-focused website or visualization, a new social presence, or, hell, we might conceive an entirely new brand.

### Setting goals and measuring success
Like the person said, “What gets measured, gets done.” And you must be extremely intentional in deciding what to measure because people will make poor choices — and waste a lot of time and money! — when their metrics don’t align with their goals. So before you decide what to measure, you must first decide and clearly communicate what you’re trying to achieve. I can help you articulate your goals, design metrics to measure your progress, and implement goal-tracking processes that will aim your team towards a common cause.

### So, Brian, what is it, exactly, that you want to do?
I’m intentionally not being very specific — every organization is different. But if you’re a news organization, non-profit, or other mission-drive team that’s trying to make the world better, and if you care about building a thoughtful, inclusive, kind workplace, I’d be excited to talk with you about consulting, contract work or a leadership role.

TKTKT One-day workshop, two-week consulting engagement, part-time contract work

TKTKT as for full-time, …….Head of product? VP, audience? Membership director? CTO/COO? Managing editor? Publisher? I help people get shit done. And there are lots of titles that fit that job description.

TKTKT do you know about a job that sounds like it's for me? thanks, pal! lemme know!
