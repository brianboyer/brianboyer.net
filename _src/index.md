# Hi, I'm Brian Boyer.

I'm an [experienced](/resume/) leader, technologist, [speaker](/writing-talks/) and [award-winning](/awards/) journalist.

And I’m on the hunt for kind, thoughtful, mission-driven people doing great work. And a place where I can use the breadth of my experience to make the world a little better.

Currently, I'm available for consulting, contract work, and (maybe!) full-time employment. I’m happy to come to you, but full-time work must be remote/Chicago-friendly.

Does this sound like you? I’d love to learn more about your team, and your vision for the future. (If you're already sold, [just scroll to the bottom](#contact)!)

## Why would you hire me?

I’ve worn a lot of hats in my career: technologist, journalist, designer, data-wrangler, project manager, and product owner, to name a few. Those are very different jobs, but the through-line — and secret to my success — is that I care deeply about teams.

Teams kick ass when we...
- Work selflessly — not tirelessly — and care for each other.
- Question dogma, test our assumptions, and value humility and curiosity.
- Build an inclusive workplace, and a team that represents our audience.
- Know our values — *why* we do what we do, not just *what* or *how*.
- Set goals that align with our mission, communicate them clearly and passionately, prioritize rigorously, and measure success every day.

## What can I do for you?
For the last two years, my job role has been “Product and People.” It’s a lot to explain, but broadly speaking, I’ve been working to build a membership-driven news product, *while at the same time*, professionalizing the operations of a fast-growing company.

So, I'm sort of a generalist, but with areas of deep expertise. Here's a handful of the things that we might work on together.

### Building membership-powered organizations
I’ve spent the last two years building successful membership programs for [Denverite](https://denverite.com), [Billy Penn](https://billypenn.com) and [The Incline](https://theincline.com). It’s tempting to think of this as merely a technical problem — CRM, payment processing, etc. But while that stuff can be tricky, the real challenge is that your organization must learn to act differently. I can help you and your team understand the high-level philosophy you must embrace to succeed at membership, as well as all the details you’ve got to get right — from the work you produce to the nitty-gritty details of product design, vendor and tool selection, email marketing, and metrics.

### Developing a user-centered product strategy
There’s a thing about products that should be obvious, but that we regularly fail at. Say it with me: “We design products to serve the needs of our audience.” I can help you better understand those needs, facilitate design exercises with your team, and develop a product strategy. We'll kill our pre-conceived notions (and internal politics) and come up with a product that works for your *audience first*. And that might be a niche newsletter, a task-focused website or visualization, or, hell, we might come up with an entirely new brand. Also, this is pretty fun!

### Leading your technology efforts
I've led teams of developers and designers for most of my career, at startups and well-established companies. (For all the gory details, check my [resume](/resume/).) We've built products, analyzed and visualized data, presented visual journalism, and lots more. I can help you consider your product/design/technical goals and lead a happy team to achieve them!

### Setting goals and measuring success
Like the person said, [“What gets measured, gets done.”](https://thecarebot.github.io/Why-should-I-Carebot/) You must be extremely intentional in what you measure because people will make poor choices — and waste a lot of time and money! — when their metrics don’t align with their goals. So before you decide what to measure, you must first decide and clearly communicate what you’re trying to achieve. I can help you articulate your goals, design metrics to measure your progress, and implement goal-tracking processes that will aim your team towards a common cause.

### Implementing processes for happiness and productivity
Work is hard. But it's often hard for all the wrong reasons. If you've got a great mission and great people, that's great! But if you've got poor process, it doesn't matter. Even the most talented people fail when they're managed poorly. I can help you implement processes that will reduce friction, increase productivity, and create a happier and more inclusive workplace.

### Smelling bullshit
The other day I was joking about being a professional “vendor sniffer” — I’ve evaluated hundreds (thousands?) of tools, most of which were bullshit. As a hiring manager, awards judge, grant judge and vendor sniffer, I’ve developed a keen sense for what’s crap, and what tools and teams know are great at what they do. If you’re looking for help deciding on a technology stack, evaluating a RFP, hiring a consulting firm, or awarding grantees, hit me up. I can help you better understand the problem you’re trying to solve, and choose the best path to solve it.

## How do we do this?
If you’re a news organization, non-profit, or other mission-driven organization that’s trying to make the world better, and if you care about building a thoughtful, inclusive, kind workplace, I’d be excited to talk with you about...

### Consulting & contract work
We could do a one-day workshop, a multi-week engagement, or part-time contract work. Let's talk through your needs first and we can design a program that works for your team, and your budget.

### A full-time leadership role
Job titles vary by organization and matter less than the work you do. (At least at the top — job titles are *super-important* to get right for your junior- and mid-level staff. Anyway!)

You may be seeking a Head of Product, VP Audience, Membership Director, General Manager, CTO/COO/CDO/CPO, Managing Editor, or Publisher. If you're looking for someone to lead your team to happiness and success, let's talk. Lots of titles that fit that job description!
