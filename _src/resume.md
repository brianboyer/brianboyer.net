# This is [Brian Boyer](/)'s résumé.
I began my career as a technologist and became a leader of software teams. With the help of a Knight Foundation grant, I found a new career in journalism. It’s been nearly a decade since I made the switch, and I believe my unusual experience has provided helpful perspectives towards the many challenges we face.

## Work

### VP, Product and People
#### [Spirited Media](https://spiritedmedia.com/) (2017-2019)
Spirited Media is creating a new model for sustainable city journalism. Shortly after joining Spirited, we began the process of launching membership, which I’ve been leading for the last year. This encompasses everything from coordinating our messaging, working with vendors, measuring success, and leading the design and development of our website and emails and every other audience touchpoint.

Because we’re a scrappy young company, I also lead a wide range of HR and operations efforts, including (but not limited to) company-wide goal setting, measuring success, employee on- and off-boarding, IT and OPSEC, knowledge management, and otherwise supporting team management and recruiting efforts.

### Senior Supervising Editor, Visuals
#### [NPR](http://npr.org/) (2012-2016)
I was hired to build a newsroom development team, but we soon merged with the multimedia team to form Visuals. We made all kinds of special things on the web, including NPR’s elections, books and music projects, as well as bespoke story presentations — all the while serving as the newsroom’s service desks for photo, video, data and graphics.

We believed strongly in user-centered design, evidence-driven decision making, and [sharing what we learned](http://blog.apps.npr.org/).

### Grant Recipient and Leader
#### [The Carebot](http://thecarebot.github.io/) (2016) and [PANDA Project](http://pandaproject.net/) (2011)
The Carebot is a prototype for a better way to create, measure and communicate meaningful analytics for newsrooms, built with help from a Knight Foundation grant.

PANDA is a newsroom data library, also built with help from a Knight Foundation grant. It is currently in use at dozens of news organizations worldwide.

### News Applications Editor
#### [Chicago Tribune](http://chicagotribune.com/) (2009-2012)
Chicago Tribune hired me to start their first newsroom development team. We built the Tribune’s elections, crime and schools products, and worked with reporters on data journalism and investigations. We designed and built a number of news properties, including [ChicagoNow](http://www.chicagonow.com/), [TribLocal](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231031341/http://triblocal.com/) (now defunct) and Hoy Chicago. Our team became the model for many newsroom development shops: releasing open-source code, [blogging about our methods](http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/), and working for the newsroom — not the IT department.

### Intern
#### [ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/) (2009)
I was the first intern on the news applications team at ProPublica. I helped the team implement best practices for software development, and [wrote some pretty fun code and stories](http://www.propublica.org/site/author/brian_boyer).

### Co-Founder, Software Architect
#### Daixo (2006-2007)
Daixo was an effort to build an awesome electronic medical records system designed for small, private practices. I led software development and marketing until leaving to pursue my master's degree.

### Director of Product Development and Senior Software Architect
#### [SAVO Group](http://www.savogroup.com/) (2005-2006)
I led all aspects of the product development process at SAVO.  This included architecture, APIs and interoperability, and automated testing, as well as creation of coding standards and best practices. Organizationally, I led the creation and implementation of new practices in project management, hiring and knowledge sharing.

### Software Architect
#### [kCura](https://www.kcura.com/) (2001-2005)
I was the first employee at kCura, where I learned the craft of software development. We created desktop, server and web applications, and worked in both consulting and product development. We were early adopters in many technologies and processes, including advanced source control, automated testing procedures, and Agile development methodologies.

### Consultant
#### Lante (2000-2001)
Lante was a dot-com consultancy that [went belly-up](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-07-20/business/0207200494_1_dot-coms-sbi-consulting) as the bubble burst, just as I was getting started there.

## Education

### Master of Science: Journalism
#### Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University (2008)
I was one of the first two students enrolled in a [Knight-funded program to bring experienced software developers into journalism](https://web.archive.org/web/20170628143539/http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/admissions/financial-aid/knight-foundation-scholarship.html). At Medill, I learned the craft of reporting, and for our final project, prototyped a set of alternative commenting models for online news — some of which are now commonplace.

### Bachelor of Science: Computer Science, Minor: Technology and Management
#### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1996-2000)
I studied computer science at UIUC, but spent most of my time in the ceramics studio. Unfortunately, engineers were forbidden from minoring in art, so I instead studied in the brand-new Technology and Management program, a sort of a mini-MBA for undergraduates.
